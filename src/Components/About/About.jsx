                      I am a third-year student at Dr. Akhilesh Das Gupta Institute of Professional Studies, passionate about technology and actively working on web development. Constantly exploring new frameworks and tools, I strive to build efficient and user-friendly solutions.

Beyond coding, I have a keen interest in the managerial aspects of the tech industry. I aim to bridge the gap between technical expertise and strategic decision-making, striving for a balance between both domains.
